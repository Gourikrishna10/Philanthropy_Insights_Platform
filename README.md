This project focuses on identifying patterns in donations based on factors such as age, gender, and geographic location. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and visualization tools, the system aims to provide valuable insights into donor demographics and preferences. These insights can help organizations and individuals understand donor behaviour, optimize philanthropic strategies, and make informed decisions to maximize the impact of their charitable efforts.
